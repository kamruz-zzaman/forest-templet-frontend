          <p>
            Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the data
            protection provisions of the Swiss Confederation (Data Protection
            Act, DSG), every person has the right to protection of their privacy
            as well as protection against misuse of their personal data. The
            operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data
            very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in
            accordance with the legal data protection regulations as well as
            this privacy policy.
            <br />
            <br />
            In cooperation with our hosting providers, we make every effort to
            protect the databases as well as possible against unauthorized
            access, loss, misuse or falsification.
            <br />
            <br /> We would like to point out that data transmission on the
            Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. A
            complete protection of data against access by third parties is not
            possible.
            <br />
            <br /> By using this website, you consent to the collection,
            processing and use of data in accordance with the following
            description. This website can generally be visited without
            registration. Data such as pages accessed or names of files
            accessed, date and time are stored on the server for statistical
            purposes without this data being directly related to your person.
            Personal data, in particular name, address or e-mail address are
            collected as far as possible on a voluntary basis. Without your
            consent, the data will not be passed on to third parties.
            <br />
            <br />
            Processing of personal data
            <br />
            Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or
            identifiable person. A data subject is a person about whom personal
            data is processed. Processing includes any handling of personal
            data, regardless of the means and procedures used, in particular the
            storage, disclosure, acquisition, deletion, storage, modification,
            destruction and use of personal data.
            <br />
            <br />
            We process personal data in accordance with Swiss data protection
            law. Furthermore, to the extent and insofar as the EU GDPR is
            applicable, we process personal data in accordance with the
            following legal bases in connection with Art. 6 (1) GDPR: lit. a)
            Processing of personal data with the consent of the data subject.
            <br />
            lit. b) Processing of personal data for the fulfillment of a
            contract with the data subject as well as for the implementation of
            corresponding pre-contractual measures.
            <br /> lit. c) Processing of personal data for the fulfillment of a
            legal obligation to which we are subject under any applicable law of
            the EU or under any applicable law of a country in which the GDPR is
            applicable in whole or in part.
            <br /> lit. d) Processing of personal data in order to protect the
            vital interests of the data subject or another natural person.
            <br /> lit. f) Processing of personal data to protect the legitimate
            interests of us or of third parties, unless the fundamental freedoms
            and rights and interests of the data subject are overridden.
            Legitimate interests include, in particular, our business interest
            in being able to provide our website, information security, the
            enforcement of our own legal claims and compliance with Swiss law.
            <br />
            <br />
            We process personal data for the duration required for the
            respective purpose or purposes. In the case of longer-term retention
            obligations due to legal and other obligations to which we are
            subject, we restrict processing accordingly.

            Cookies
            <br />
            This website uses cookies. These are small text files that make it
            possible to store specific information related to the user on the
            user's terminal device while the user is using the website. Cookies
            make it possible, in particular, to determine the frequency of use
            and number of users of the pages, to analyze behavior patterns of
            page use, but also to make our offer more customer-friendly. Cookies
            remain stored beyond the end of a browser session and can be
            retrieved when you visit the site again. If you do not wish this to
            happen, you should set your Internet browser so that it refuses to
            accept cookies.
            <br />
            <br />A general objection to the use of cookies used for online
            marketing purposes can be declared for a large number of the
            services, especially in the case of tracking, via the U.S. site
            http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU site
            <br />
            http://www.youronlinechoices.com/. Furthermore, the storage of
            cookies can be achieved by disabling them in the browser settings.
            Please note that in this case not all functions of this online offer
            can be used.
            <br />
            <br />
            Without SSL/TLS encryption
            <br />
            Please note that data transmitted over an open network such as the
            Internet or an e-mail service without SSL encryption can be viewed
            by anyone. You can recognize an unencrypted connection by the fact
            that the address line of the browser shows "http://" and no lock
            symbol is displayed in your browser line. Information transmitted
            over the Internet and content received online may be transmitted
            over third-party networks. We cannot guarantee the confidentiality
            of any communications or materials transmitted over such open or
            third-party networks.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you disclose personally identifiable information over an open
            network or third-party networks, you should be aware that your
            information may be lost or potentially accessed by third parties
            and, as a result, the information may be collected and used without
            your consent. While in many cases the individual data packets are
            transmitted in encrypted form, the names of the sender and recipient
            are not. Even if the sender and the recipient reside in the same
            country, the data transfer via such networks often takes place
            without controls even via third countries, i.e. also via countries
            that do not offer the same level of data protection as your country
            of domicile. We assume no responsibility for the security of your
            data during transmission over the Internet and disclaim any
            liability for direct or indirect losses. We ask you to use other
            means of communication should you consider this necessary or
            reasonable for security reasons.
            <br />
            <br />
            Despite extensive technical and organizational security precautions,
            it is possible that data may be lost or intercepted and/or
            manipulated by unauthorized persons. As far as possible, we take
            appropriate technical and organizational security measures to
            prevent this within our system. However, your computer is outside
            the security perimeter under our control. It is your responsibility
            as a user to inform yourself about the necessary security
            precautions and to take appropriate measures in this regard. As the
            website operator, we are in no way liable for any damage that you
            may suffer as a result of data loss or manipulation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Data that you enter in online forms may be passed on to authorized
            third parties for the purpose of order processing and may be viewed
            and possibly processed by them.
            <br />
            <br />
            Contact form
            <br />
            If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your data from the
            inquiry form including the contact data you provided there will be
            stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case
            of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your
            consent.

            Copyrights
            <br />
            The copyright and all other rights to the content, images, photos or
            other files on the website belong exclusively to the operator of
            this website or the specifically named copyright holders. For the
            reproduction of all files, the written consent of the copyright
            holder must be obtained in advance.
            <br />
            Anyone who commits a copyright infringement without the consent of
            the respective copyright holder may be liable to prosecution and
            possibly to damages.

            Disclaimer
            <br />
            All information on our website has been carefully checked. We make
            every effort to ensure that the information we provide is
            up-to-date, correct and complete. Nevertheless, the occurrence of
            errors can not be completely excluded, so we can not guarantee the
            completeness, accuracy and timeliness of information, including
            journalistic-editorial nature. Liability claims regarding damage
            caused by the use of any information provided, including any kind of
            information which is incomplete or incorrect, will therefore be
            rejected.
            <br />
            The publisher may change or delete texts at his own discretion and
            without notice and is not obliged to update the contents of this
            website. The use of or access to this website is at the visitor's
            own risk. The publisher, its clients or partners are not responsible
            for damages, such as direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or

            <br />
            The publisher also accepts no responsibility or liability for the

            accessed via external links on this website. The operators of the
            linked sites are solely responsible for their content. The publisher
            thus expressly distances itself from all third-party content that
            may be relevant under criminal or liability law or that may offend
            common decency.

            Google Maps
            <br />
            This website uses the offer of Google Maps. This allows us to
            display interactive maps directly on the website and enables you to
            comfortably use the map function. By visiting the website, Google
            receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding
            subpage of our website. This occurs regardless of whether Google
            provides a user account through which you are logged in or whether
            there is no user account. If you are logged in to Google, your data
            will be directly assigned to your account. If you do not want the
            assignment with your profile at Google, you must log out before
            activating the button. Google stores your data as usage profiles and
            uses them for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or
            demand-oriented design of its website. Such an evaluation is carried
            out in particular (even for users who are not logged in) to provide
            needs-based advertising and to inform other users of the social
            network about your activities on our website. You have the right to
            object to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must
            contact Google to exercise this right. For more information on the
            purpose and scope of data collection and processing by Google, as
            well as further information on your rights in this regard and

            Google Ads
            <br />
            This website uses Google conversion tracking. If you have reached
            our website via an ad placed by Google, Google Ads will set a cookie
            on your computer. The conversion tracking cookie is set when a user
            clicks on an ad placed by Google. These cookies lose their validity
            after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the
            user visits certain pages of our website and the cookie has not yet
            expired, we and Google can recognize that the user clicked on the ad
            and was redirected to this page. Each Google Ads customer receives a
            different cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked across Ads
            customers' websites. The information obtained using the conversion
            cookie is used to create conversion statistics for Ads customers who
            have opted in to conversion tracking. Clients learn the total number
            of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page
            tagged with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive
            any information that can be used to personally identify users.
            <br />
            If you do not wish to participate in the tracking, you can refuse
            the setting of a cookie required for this - for example, by means of
            a browser setting that generally deactivates the automatic setting
            of cookies or by setting your browser so that cookies from the
            domain "googleleadservices.com" are blocked.
            <br />
            Please note that you may not delete the opt-out cookies as long as
            you do not want any measurement data to be recorded. If you have
            deleted all your cookies in the browser, you must set the respective
            opt-out cookie again.

            Data transfer to the USA
            <br />
            Among other things, tools from companies based in the USA are
            integrated on our website. If these tools are active, your personal
            data may be transferred to the US servers of the respective
            companies. We would like to point out that the USA is not a safe
            third country in the sense of EU data protection law. US companies
            are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities
            without you as a data subject being able to take legal action
            against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US authorities
            (e.g. intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently store
            your data located on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no
            influence on these processing activities.
            <br />

            Changes
            <br />
            We may amend this privacy policy at any time without prior notice.
            The current version published on our website applies. Insofar as the
            data protection declaration is part of an agreement with you, we
            will inform you of the change by e-mail or other suitable means in
            the event of an update.
